# Development

**TL;DR:** Find the package layout and development checks here.

## Layout

**TL;DR:** Application code lives in `src/dichotomise/`; tests live in `tests/`.

```text
src/dichotomise/
  cli.py               # the `dichotomise` command (Click + Rich)
  pipeline.py           # runs every stage in order
  run.py                 # output paths for one run
  errors.py              # error types
  stages/                 # one file per pipeline stage
  pydcm/                   # DICOM-specific metadata and sanitisation logic
    policies/                # the sanitisation policy JSON files
    names.py                 # a self-contained adjective+surname placeholder-name generator
  utils/                    # generic filesystem/archive/console helpers
```

## Development

**TL;DR:** Use uv to run the test suite, formatter, linter and type checker.

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy src
```

`tests/data/` (real, non-synthetic scan exports used for some tests) is
gitignored and never committed. It may contain identifying information.

Large exports are read, sanitised and re-checked by several processes. The `dichotomise`
command handles this itself. If you call the Python API from your own script (`run_pipeline`,
`capture`, `finalise`, the sanitise functions or `iter_dicom_metadata`), put the call under
`if __name__ == "__main__":`.
