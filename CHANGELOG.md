# Changelog

## v2.7.1

- Docs only, plus one help string. README: `--qc` prints the audit table and NOTES (the `--qc` help
  text said "tables only"); SOP-UID conflicts are checked across the whole study (the whole source
  directory under `--qc`); the numerically first duplicate is kept; byte-identical copies in
  different folders are not flagged and collapse to one output file; the filename carries the
  original UID only under a policy that does not reissue UIDs (`retain`); the install table of
  contents points at real headings.

## v2.7.0

**Breaking: rectified filenames change.** Files are now named
`<series>_<instance>_<SOPInstanceUID>_e<echo>.dcm` (previously
`<series>_<SeriesInstanceUID>_<instance>_e<echo>.dcm`). The SOP Instance UID is unique per file, so
names no longer rely on instance numbers. With `--sanitise`, files are renamed after their UID is
regenerated, so the filename matches the header and no longer carries the original UID.

- A duplicate is now strictly a byte-for-byte copy. Previously a file was a duplicate if its parsed
  content matched another file's, ignoring its SOP Instance UID and creation time. A re-saved copy
  with a new UID is therefore no longer reported as a duplicate.
- Files that share a SOP Instance UID but differ in bytes are no longer treated as duplicates. They
  go to review with reason `sop_conflict`, and the run continues.
- The duplicate you keep is the numerically first file (`2.dcm` before `10.dcm`), not the first in
  string order.
- A NOTES section follows the audit table and is written to `stage-01-report.json` (`notes`) and
  `stage-01-audit.csv` (`notes`, `sop_conflict_count`). It names the file that belongs to another
  series, which files repeat which, and why series metadata varies.
- Enhanced (multi-frame) MR: the echo number and time are read from the per-frame groups, so
  multi-echo files are no longer all named `_e01`. Each series now reports echoes, ASL
  label/control and an inferred TI index (stage-03 report `series_inventory`). The TI is inferred
  from acquisition order only, and only when the headers state no inversion time.
- Byte-identical files that land on one name in the review tree are written once instead of
  getting `-dupNN` names (`review_identical_files_not_rewritten` in `stage-02-report.json`).
- `stage-01-audit.csv` gains `sop_conflict_count` and `notes` columns.

## v2.6.5

- Archive creation (source, dichotomised, and review archives) now prefers `pigz` for gzip compression when it's on PATH -- parallel across CPU cores, versus the single-threaded stdlib `gzip`/`zlib` codec used otherwise. The CLI reports "pigz found, using it." up front when it's available.

## v2.6.4

- README: document plain `venv` and conda/mamba as the primary install paths; `uv` is now its own section, kept for continuity with this project's dev/CI setup rather than presented as the default.
- No other code changes; this is the release tagged with an actual GitHub release, to trigger Zenodo DOI archiving via its release webhook (v2.6.3 only got a git tag + PyPI/container publish).

## v2.6.3

- No code changes; cuts a release/tag to trigger Zenodo DOI archiving via the GitHub release webhook.

## v2.6.2

- More informative CLI output: an opening banner (version, source path, and either the output directory or "QC Mode"), a subject/file count right after capture, a live "Time elapsed" ticker while a run is in progress (interactive terminals only), and a total-time summary at the end.
- Archive creation (source, dichotomised, and review archives) now reports byte progress (`KB done/KB total`) on an interactive terminal.
- The banner's "Output:" line now shows the actual created, timestamped run folder rather than the raw `--out-dir` argument.
- `--keep-working-files` now warns that it keeps a full second copy of every subject's files on disk, on top of the archive.
- Long paths in CLI output (banner, success/error messages) no longer wrap mid-path.

## v2.6.0

- QC/audit tables (CLI and `stage-01-report.json`/`stage-01-audit.csv`) now sort series folders in numeric series order (e.g. `..._6_MR` before `..._29_MR`) instead of alphabetically.
- Cut redundant DICOM copying: `capture()` no longer copies files into a working tree, and `sift()` is now a logical split — rectify() is the pipeline's one real copy of each file's bytes, reading straight from the original source.
- `source_archive()` now archives each subject's files straight from the original source directory, before anything else touches them, rather than from a working copy.
- `archives/` now holds the source archive alongside the dichotomised and review archives (previously a separate `source/` folder).
- New `--keep-unzipped` flag: in addition to the always-created archive, also writes each study's final (optionally sanitised) files unarchived, into `final/` — e.g. for a later BIDS conversion.

## v2.5.0

- Published Docker and Apptainer/Singularity images to GHCR on every release, alongside PyPI.
- Added `scripts/dichotomise-container`, a wrapper with the exact same CLI as native `dichotomise` (its `--help` is byte-identical) that runs everything inside the published container — auto-detects `docker`/`apptainer` and handles the bind mounts for you.
- CI now auto-tags `main` whenever `pyproject.toml`'s version changes, so a version bump alone triggers the PyPI release and container builds with no manual tagging step.

## v2.4.0

- Review files (duplicates, misfiled) no longer disappear with the working directory by default. They're renamed like retained files, then archived separately as a checksummed `review-archive.tar.gz` in `archives/`.
- `--sanitise` now covers review files too — same policy, same replacement IDs as the main archive, so excluded files can't leak real PHI in a sanitised run.
- A rename collision in review (misfiled/duplicate metadata causes these) no longer aborts the run; colliding files get a `-dupNN` suffix.
- New per-subject manifests: `source-manifest.csv`, `retained-manifest.csv`, `review-manifest.csv` — file, size, timestamps.
- `stage-02-report.json` gained `review_rename_collisions`, `review_archive`, `review_archive_checksum`, `review_archive_sanitised`.
- CLI summary table: new "Review archive" column.
