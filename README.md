## Why dichotomise?

**TL;DR:** Scanner exports reuse filenames and can contain duplicated or
misfiled images. Dichotomise checks DICOM headers and file content to make
those problems visible.

XA60+ exports name files `1.dcm`, `2.dcm` and so on in every series folder.
Two unrelated images can therefore have the same filename. Once a file is
separated from its folder, the filename does not identify it, even though its
header carries a SOP Instance UID.

The export format makes good data-handling practice difficult. Dichotomise
addresses each problem as follows:

| Export problem | What dichotomise does |
|---|---|
| Repeated filenames hide file identity and can collide when files are moved. | Uses the SOP Instance UID from the header in each rectified filename. |
| A file's series folder can contradict its header. | Audits series metadata and sends files that disagree with their folder's majority to review. |
| A repeated export can add byte-identical files. | Detects byte-identical copies within each source folder and sends later copies to review. A copy in another folder is written once, not twice. |
| Two different files can claim one SOP Instance UID. | Sends every file in the group to review as a `sop_conflict`, never as a duplicate. |
| Processing can obscure the original export. | Archives the untouched source DICOMs and records manifests before processing. |

Two examples prompted this work. One Series 22 image was found in a Series 21
folder. In another export, an 81-image DWI series appeared twice as 162 files;
each duplicate pair was byte-identical. The files show what happened to the
export, but do not establish the underlying cause.

Read the [background and incident accounts](docs/background.md) for the
examples, evidence and limitations. The [workflow guide](docs/workflow.md)
explains the checks and how retained and review files are handled.

## Installation

**TL;DR:** Create a Python 3.11+ virtual environment and install from PyPI.

```bash
python3.11 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install dichotomise
dichotomise --help
```

For conda, uv, source checkouts and containers, see the
[installation guide](docs/installation.md).

## Quick start

**TL;DR:** Give dichotomise a source directory and an output directory. Use
`--qc` to audit the source in place without creating files.

```bash
dichotomise --source-dir ./study/sub-001 --out-dir ./dichotomise-runs
```

```bash
dichotomise --qc --source-dir ./study/sub-001
```

To only sort a folder of DICOMs into `<subject>/<series>/` subfolders, use `--sort`. It works in
place when every file sits directly in the source folder (no `--out-dir`); otherwise give `--out-dir`
to sort a copy. Add `--dry-run` first to see the plan; in place **moves your originals**.

```bash
dichotomise --sort --dry-run --source-dir ./study/sub-001
dichotomise --sort --source-dir ./study/sub-001
```

Use `--sanitise` to apply a policy to processed and review files. Choose the
policy carefully: descriptions can contain identifying text, and the
untouched **source archive retains the original identifiers**. See the
[sanitisation policies](docs/sanitise-policies.md) before sharing output.

See [usage and output](docs/usage.md) for all options, mapping files, archive
contents and reports.
