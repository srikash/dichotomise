"""Stage 5: copy retained files into metadata-named, series-ordered folders.

This is the pipeline's first and only copy of each file's bytes: capture()
and sift() work from the original source files in place, so rectify() (and
rectify_review() below) read straight from those original paths.

Each stage first *plans* (decides every target name, no file touched) and then
copies the plan, so the sanitise stage can write straight from the source files.
